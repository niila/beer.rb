# Beer.rb
For people who want to learn to program but don't like waffles.

## Prerequisites
* A Macbook or machine running Linux or Unix
* Ruby
* Git

On a Mac, you'll already have Ruby installed (version 1.8.7). For git, you need to do a little bit more unfortunately, but the people at GitHub wrote a [really cool tutorial][git-tut] explaining everything much better than I can.

## Usage
1. Start Terminal.app (if you've done the [Git Tutorial][git-tut] you already know how to do this)
2. Clone this repository by typing (or copy pasting)
    `git clone git@github.com:vindia/beer.rb.git`
3. Change to the new directory with `cd beer.rb` 
4. Run beer.rb with `ruby beer.rb`
5. Check the output!

## How to learn
1. Read the code and try do understand what each line does.
2. Try to make the code do more things. 
    1. Make the amount of beer go to zero when you spill the bottle, using a `spill` method.
    2. Change something about the `temperature` property, so you can compare the temperatures of different beers better (e.g. Beer A is colder than Beer B)
    3. Make the `drink` method shorter, i.e. use less characters to keep the same behavior (tip: search for `increment` and / or `assignment`)
